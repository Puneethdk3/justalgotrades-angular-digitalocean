    <!-- <p>22. <b>REFUND & CANCELLATION POLICY:</b></p>

By default brokerage including government charges is assumed as 0.03% of turnover and there may be slight difference in your contract note and we are not responsible for that.  </p> -->
    <p>22. <b>REFUND & CANCELLATION POLICY:</b></p>
    <p>We do not offer any refund and cancellation with respect to the amount paid on your profit making day. </p> 

    <p>23. <b>Slippages:</b></p>
    <p>On a live trading day, slippages are normal and we can't do much with that. Though we select only liquid stocks, if the number of shares to exit are more compared to market depth, you will endup exiting at a price which may reduce the profit and we are not responsible for that. On a volatile day or on a day where stock price is volatile, your stop loss will be executed at costlier price and we can't do anything with these scenarios.</p>

    <p>24. <b>Circuit hit:</b></p>
    <p>When share of a price hit upper or lower circuit and your position in the stock is in loss, then we can't exit the position untill circuit is opened in case of f&o shares and in case of non f&o shares, circuit will not open during rest of the trading day. In this case, your respective broker will exit the position on auction in the next T+2 days. Because of this, your loss will be higher and we are not responsible for these kind of scenarios.</p>

    <p>25. <b>Exit of positions:</b></p>
    <p>We will always try to exit positions @ 3PM. We are not responsible in case of not exiting the position because of internet connectivity or server problem. In that case your respective broker will charge for squareoff from their end and we are not responsible for these charges.</p>

    <p>26. <b>Entry of trades:</b></p>
    <p>On a volatile day because of national or global news, we will try to avoid entering because of risk in terms of stop loss getting hit in many of our trades. We are not responsible for not entering the trades on any given day where in we face any internet connectivity issue or our server going down or any glitch in our algorithm code.</p>

    <p>26. <b>Payment fraud:</b></p>
    <p>We use third party providers to make payment and we dont store any card/secure details related to your payment transaction. As we use third party providers, if any fraud happens in their side, we are not responsible.</p>

    <p>27. <b>Storing account details:</b></p>
    <p>When you provide your demat account login details for us to autogenerate accesstoken to execute trades in your trading account, we will store AccountId as it is and password will be encrypted. Many of the websites around the world have already faced cyber attack on the data stored and our website is not an exception for that in case if it happens. Though we take all precautionary action, if any hack attempt happens and if data is stolen, we are not responsible for your account details stored in our database. Data might be login details for our website or login details of your respective broker account.</p>

    <p>28. <b>Strategy performance results:</b></p>
    <p>Strategy performance shown in https://www.justalgotrades.com/performance.html is a backtested version and not the live one. It considers minimum slippage, but when traded on live, slippage can vary. Though share price moves based on historical probability most of the time, we can't gurantee that same performance of results continue in future also.</p>
